Author - Anishka khawar

This project predicts the likelihood of Autism Spectrum Disorder (ASD) based on behavioral and demographic data.
It applies seven different machine learning algorithms — Logistic Regression, Random Forest, SVM, Naive Bayes, Decision Tree, KNN, and XGBoost — to compare performance and find the most effective model.

Features
Data preprocessing with label encoding, feature engineering, and outlier remova
Balancing the dataset using oversampling techniques
Training and evaluating multiple ML models
Saving trained models for later use
Visualizations including ROC curves and confusion matrices for model comparison

Tech Stack
Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, XGBoost, imbalanced-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn

How It Works
Upload your dataset in .csv format directly in Google Colab.
The script preprocesses and cleans the data.
All 7 models are trained, evaluated, and compared.
Performance metrics and visualizations are displayed.
